# Choosing the Right Template for Calliope mini

No matter which version of Calliope mini you have or whether you're programming on a mobile device or PC, you can always create a New Project and start programming.

If you're using Calliope mini 2, you can also choose the optimized template designed specifically for it. This allows your mini to utilize the full 32KB of available RAM. The settings loaded with the mini 2 template can also be activated in any existing project through the settings menu.

If you encounter performance issues with the default template ("mini 1 template" or "New Project") and your mini 1 freezes, it may be due to limited available RAM. To free up more memory for your program, you can disable autolading the Bluetooth functionality in the settings. Bluetooth will only be active when displaying patterns on the LED matrix. To do this, perform the "brace grip": hold down buttons A and B, briefly tap the Reset button, and continue holding A and B until the pattern appears on the LED matrix.

Regardless of your mini version, if you include the radio extension in your program, the Bluetooth functionality will be set to manual loading. This means that before transferring your program to mobile devices, you will need to perform the "brace grip" to activate Bluetooth each time.

## Additional Notes for iOS Users:

If you have previously recorded your Calliope mini with another editor or programmed it with the Calliope mini 2.x template, you cannot transfer the normal project template directly to mobile. The Bluetooth settings have changed in this template, so one of the following steps is necessary so that you can transfer your program to mobile devices without any problems:

### Option A: Load Program 25 (Calliope mini 2.x):

To load Program with the number '25' onto your Calliope mini, follow these steps:

1. Press and hold the reset button on your Calliope mini for approximately 5 seconds until all LEDs briefly light up and then turn off.
2. Press the 'A' button to go back one step. This will illuminate the 25th LED on the display.
3. Press the 'A' and 'B' buttons simultaneously to confirm your selection and load Program 25. This process also resolves any other transfer issues. Once completed, your Calliope mini will be restored to its default state.

### Option B: Load the Demo Program:

In the Calliope mini app, navigate to the 'Editors and Programs' section and locate the 'Start Program' option. Load this program onto your Calliope mini, and you'll be able to use the standard project template without any concerns.
