# Which template to choose?

From now on you don't have to worry about which project template (Calliope mini 1.x or Calliope mini 2.x) is the right one for you. Just click on `|New Project|` to start programming on your Calliope mini. If you are using the Calliope mini mobile, it may still make sense to use one of the two iOS project templates. You can find more information in the following.

## Notes for iOS users:

If you have previously recorded your Calliope mini with another editor or programmed it with one of the iOS project templates (Calliope mini 1.x or Calliope mini 2.x), you cannot transfer the normal project template directly to mobile. The Bluetooth settings have changed in this template, so one of the following steps is necessary so that you can transfer your programme to mobile devices without any problems.

### a) Load programme 25 from the flash memory (Calliope mini 2.x):

To load the programme with the number '25' onto your Calliope mini, please follow these steps:

- Press and hold the reset button on your Calliope mini for about 5 seconds until all LEDs light up briefly and then go out.
- Press the 'A' button to go back one step. This should light up the 25th LED on the display.
- Press the 'A' and 'B' keys simultaneously to confirm your selection and load programme 25.
By the way, this procedure will also solve any other problems that may occur during the transfer. After the transfer, the Calliope mini is back in the 'delivery state'.

### b) Load the demo programme or a new project (Calliope mini 1.x and Calliope mini 2.x):

In the Calliope mini app, you will find the 'Start programme' in the 'Editors and programmes' section. As soon as you play this onto your Calliope mini, you can use the normal project template.

### c) Using the iOS project templates

If it is not possible to transfer the new project in this way, you can continue to use the iOS project templates until you are able to transfer the 'demo program'.
