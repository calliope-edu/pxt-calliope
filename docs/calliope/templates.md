    "description": "This is a new project, developed for use with iOS devices. If you have not used MakeCode before, you can also use the standard project template. To do this, you need to transfer the demo programme to the Calliope mini once. Press the reset button for 5 seconds until the LED matrix flashes briefly and the red LED at the top left lights up. Navigate to the 25th programme by pressing button A to go back one step. Press keys A and B simultaneously. Now the demo programme is loaded onto the Calliope mini. You can always carry out these three steps if there are problems with the connection to the iPad.",

    "description": "This project template is suitable for all Calliope mini up to version 1.3. The standard project template may allow you to transfer more complex programmes to your Calliope mini. In addition, further functions are activated. To do this, you either need to load the demo program onto your Calliope mini or transfer a hex file from the standard project template once via USB connection. If you are satisfied with the current range of functions, you can simply continue to use this version.",
