Here are some cool tutorials to get you started with your @boardname@!

## Basic

```codecard
[
  {
    "name": "Calliope mini 2.x",
    "url":"_6wpJJxes0czy",
    "description": "The Calliope mini 2.x has more memory than previous versions. To make better use of this memory, we have made special presets in this project. Attention: To be able to play this template on your Calliope mini, you have to transfer the demo program to the Calliope mini once. Either from the flash memory, from the app or via USB connection. The easiest and fastest way is to copy from the flash memory. To do this, press and hold Reset for about 5 seconds until the LED matrix of the Calliope mini flashes twice. The red LED in the upper left corner is now on. If you now press the A button once, the LED at the bottom right will light up. If you press A+B at the same time, this program will be copied to your Calliope mini and you can start right away.",

    "name": "Calliope mini 1.x",
    "url":"_dy85AC94M1Yu",
    "description": "This template is suitable for all Calliope mini, but especially up to version 1.3. If you have such a Calliope mini or an earlier version, you can start directly with this template. The normal project template may be able to copy even more complex programs to your Calliope mini and additional features like partial flashing (i.e. faster copying for only small program changes) will be enabled. For this to work, however, you must either load the demo program onto your Calliope mini or transfer a Hex file from the normal project template once via USB connection. If you are satisfied with the current functionality, you can simply continue to use this version.",
